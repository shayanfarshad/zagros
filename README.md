# zagros
zagros test app for interview , authetication with flatlist , fake data and api 


# start

pull from the github 

add yarn command in cmd to install node_modules 

run yarn android 

my xcode need to download the update to new version , and ios version is not completed. 

# docs

I use typescripts , react navigation , asyncstorage for this project .
and react-native-auth0 for authetication .

# definition 

I used the pagination with button also I could use onReachEnd for flatlist. 

Most of the time that was taken from me for this project was due to the lack of API
And it took me a long time to find an API that works properly.
